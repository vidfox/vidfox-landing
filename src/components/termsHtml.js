                        <br />
                        <p>These General Terms apply generally to the use of the service FrontBase (the "Service" or “FrontBase”), and constitute a contract between you and the company FrontBase ("The Company"). These terms govern your access to and use of the FrontBase application and website (the "Service"), and any video, sound, text, graphics, or other materials sent, received, stored or otherwise appearing in the Service (collectively referred to as "Content"). Parts of the Service may display Content that is not FrontBase's (“User Content”). Such content is the sole responsibility of the person or entity that has made it available. When "Content" is used in this document, it refers to both content provided by FrontBase and User Content collectively, unless otherwise specified.
                        
                        
                        Where applicable, "The Company" shall also be understood as a reference to affiliates, suppliers, partners and other third parties FrontBase may engage or otherwise cooperate with in connection with the Service
                        
                        
                        By using FrontBase you agree to these General Terms and the Privacy Policy (collectively referred to as "Terms"). Please read them carefully. If you don’t agree to the Terms, you can’t use FrontBase.
                        
                        
                        We may change these Terms at any time. If a change is material, we’ll let you know before it takes effect provided that we have your correct email address. By using FrontBase on or after that effective date, you agree to the new Terms. If you don’t agree to them, you should delete your account before they take effect, otherwise your use of the Service and Content will be subject to the new Terms.
                        
                        
                        Scope of FrontBase services</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            As the provider of the FrontBase Service, FrontBase does not own, create, sell, resell, provide, control, manage, offer, deliver, or supply any Host Services. Hosts alone are responsible for their Listings and Host Services. When Members make or accept a booking, they are entering into a contract directly with each other. FrontBase is not and does not become a party to or other participant in any contractual relationship between Members. FrontBase is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member, except for collecting Services fees, as described in this document.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                        You might be using FrontBase Service to create an individual profile, and provide services, as defined in this document, over paid-for video calls (referred as “Host”), or seek such services (referred as “User”).
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                        While we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes, FrontBase has no control over and does not guarantee (i) the truth or accuracy of any Listing descriptions, Ratings, Reviews, or other Member Content, or (ii) the performance or conduct of any Member or third party. FrontBase does not endorse any Member, Listing or Host Services. Any references to a Member being "verified" (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification or identification process and nothing else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by FrontBase about any Member, including of the Member's identity or background or whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable.
                        </p>
                        <br />

By using FrontBase, you affirm that you are over the age limit effective for your country of residence. If we learn that someone under the minimum allowed age is using FrontBase, we’ll terminate their account. For use in educational or other settings, contact us.

                    <br />

                      <p>Your use of FrontBase requires that you have hardware, software and an Internet connection fulfilling certain recommended requirements, as may be specified in our Support Center. If the recommended requirements are not met, you may potentially still use the Service, but normally with a lower quality or performance. Such reduced quality or performance will not give you the right to claim any compensation from FrontBase.
                    </p>
                      
                    <p> 
                    To use the Service, you will need to create a personal FrontBase account. You may register an account by following the instructions on the Website or other instructions prompted to you. You are responsible for providing and maintaining accurate and updated personal information, and for safeguarding your account information. You may not select or use an identity of another person with the intent to impersonate that person. You must use a valid email address, and FrontBase reserves the right to verify this at any time. FrontBase will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements.
                </p> 
                <p> 
                      Your account is strictly personal and shall not be used by any other person without your supervision. Neither shall you assign your account to any other person. You are in any event solely responsible for the use of the Service through your personal user account.
                    </p>

                      Disclaimer of warranty. FrontBase provides the Service to you "as is". You acknowledge that the Service is not error-free. You use it at your own risk and discretion. That means the Service doesn’t come with any warranty. None express, none implied. The service will be continually developed, and you acknowledge that changes to functionality and layout may be carried out without advance notice. FrontBase makes no warranties, expressed or implied, with respect to the availability, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, accuracy, completeness, performance and quality of the Service. FrontBase will from time to time have to carry out updates and maintenance of the Service, due to technical, security or operational reasons, during which time the Service might be unavailable. FrontBase will make reasonable efforts to arrange updates and maintenance outside of peak usage hours.

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless FrontBase and its partners from all claims, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) that arise from your misuse of the Service in breach of the Terms or applicable laws. FrontBase reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you.
